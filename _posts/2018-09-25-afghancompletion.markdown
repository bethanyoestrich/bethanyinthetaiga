I finished the first of my Christmas gift crochet projects last evening -- the Basketweave afghan for my
MIL! The border has been added and all the ends woven in, so it can get the official "complete" stamp! Overall, the project took approximately 2 1/2 weeks to complete which should allow me to stay on time for completion.

This was the second time I've used this pattern and its a perfect pattern to do when watching TV or movies since its essentially all double crochet except for the small sections that create the weave effect. The previous version and pattern suggested three colors for the afghan, but I really like the way this one turned out with four colors. My MIL likes plaids and blues/browns and I think this afghan is going to fit in perfectly in her home!

My very favorite border pattern is the spot on edging by attic24 which is what I used on this afghan. The instructions can be found here -- http://attic24.typepad.com/weblog/spot-on-edging-2.html (though be aware that the instructions use British terms).

As this is a new blog, I'm still working on formatting and such and have not had the chance to photograph the afghan yet. Pictures should be included by the weekend.

I have a lighter work schedule this week, so I am hoping to start working on my very first pattern inspired by art deco ginko leaves as well as finish up a quick shawl for myself. Fingers crossed that my idea for the ginko blanket works out and I'll have more to share later this week!
