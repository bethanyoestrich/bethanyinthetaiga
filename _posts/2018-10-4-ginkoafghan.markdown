My mother loves arts and crafts style and I've always found the gingko motifs commonly found in the style to be exceptionally beautiful. While working on a "Oh My Blanket" for my own home, I noticed the similarities between the shell pattern and gingko patterns present in wallpaper and other textiles and decided to utilize a shell pattern for my mother's Christmas afghan. Originally I attempted to try to create my own pattern to add stems to the leaves, but that did not work well and I stuck with the original Oh My Blanket pattern located here -- https://www.mooglyblog.com/oh-my-blanket/ .

Earthy watercolors and glazes are utilized in much of the art from the period and thought the new red heart supersaver ombre would be a good way to (economically) reflect that variation in colors. For this afghan I'm using redheart supersaver ombre's "Candy Apple" and redheart supersaver solids "Cornmeal". I've seen some really ornate handcrafted wooden frames used in arts and crafts pieces and I'm still trying to figure out the best way to reflect that in the border when I reach that point -- i'm considering using a deep mahogany or claret colored border, possibly with some deep blue accents.

So far I'm about a foot into the project and am really enjoying how the changes in green and yellow are crocheting up and I feel like intended style is really coming through.
