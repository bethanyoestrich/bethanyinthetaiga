Welcome to the "Bethany in the Taiga" blog! Congratulations on finding your way to one of the odder corners of the internet! I've been knitting for nearly 13 years and crocheting for almost 7. After taking a several year break from the yarn arts due to an incredibly stressful job, I recently got back into crochet and now spend almost all of my free evenings working on afghans and other crocheted objects. My main motivation to start this blog came from a challenge to crochet or craft a gift for every person on my Christmas list and at least in the beginning, I hope to document that process here!
