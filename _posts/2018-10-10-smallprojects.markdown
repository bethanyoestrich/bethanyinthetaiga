If theres one thing I've learned about myself in crochet obsession 2.0, its that I enjoy long term projects much more than quicker projects. If I had to venture a guess, I'd think this likely streams from EVERY thing taking forever when knitting as compared to crochet.

My BFF K Rex has recently begun several (beautiful!) smaller projects and I figured I would try to follow suit. A few weeks ago I had my appendix removed in a super easy procedure but unexpected procedure and figured it would be easiest to have my father grab a single ball of yarn and hook and made a very simple granny square shawl with some leftover mandala yarn. Color is life and I love the rainbow gradition of the mandala yarn and feel like it created an overall really beautiful scarf.

My gauge is constantly very very very extremely tight (can I blame that on knitting for 10 years prior to crocheting?!?). I recently became an aunt and my sister in law requested a Detroit Redwings sweater for the newborn photoshoot (seriously if you're a pens fan, unsubscribe yourself from this blog!). I managed to make a newborn sweater that couldn't even fit a baby kitten but is super adorable (but unusable for a human baby!). If you learned knitting prior to crochet and have any tricks for maintaining a loose gage please let me know!

Not to continue to harp on my surgery, but I am a HUGE fan of baths and the two week post op period where incisions are not allowed to soak in water was THE WORST! To celebrate being able to take a long soak (and to be perfectly honest to allow me to play around with the Redheart Scrubby yarn I've been fascinated with since it was introduced) I made a bath scrubby using a mix of Sugar and Cream and Scrubby. Again, the "gauge" monster struck and I had some fairly severe issues when I began to fix the two yarns. Overall I'm pleased with the end result, but this had resolidified my need to work on making my gauge more accurate.
