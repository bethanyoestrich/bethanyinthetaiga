As I mentioned in my "intro" post, I'm currently working to craft a gift for everyone on my Christmas list. My current crochet project is a Basketweave Afghan for my mother-in-law. I previously completed another version of this same afghan as a housewarming gift for my aunt and though its not particularly my style, the DTRFP stitch makes it interesting to crochet. As of today, the afghan is about 75% complete and I'm hoping to finish it before going on vacation next week.
