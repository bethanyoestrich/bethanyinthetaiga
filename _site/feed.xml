If I had to venture a guess, I’d think this likely streams from EVERY thing taking forever when knitting as compared to crochet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My BFF K Rex has recently begun several (beautiful!) smaller projects and I figured I would try to follow suit. A few weeks ago I had my appendix removed in a super easy procedure but unexpected procedure and figured it would be easiest to have my father grab a single ball of yarn and hook and made a very simple granny square shawl with some leftover mandala yarn. Color is life and I love the rainbow gradition of the mandala yarn and feel like it created an overall really beautiful scarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gauge is constantly very very very extremely tight (can I blame that on knitting for 10 years prior to crocheting?!?). I recently became an aunt and my sister in law requested a Detroit Redwings sweater for the newborn photoshoot (seriously if you’re a pens fan, unsubscribe yourself from this blog!). I managed to make a newborn sweater that couldn’t even fit a baby kitten but is super adorable (but unusable for a human baby!). If you learned knitting prior to crochet and have any tricks for maintaining a loose gage please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to continue to harp on my surgery, but I am a HUGE fan of baths and the two week post op period where incisions are not allowed to soak in water was THE WORST! To celebrate being able to take a long soak (and to be perfectly honest to allow me to play around with the Redheart Scrubby yarn I’ve been fascinated with since it was introduced) I made a bath scrubby using a mix of Sugar and Cream and Scrubby. Again, the “gauge” monster struck and I had some fairly severe issues when I began to fix the two yarns. Overall I’m pleased with the end result, but this had resolidified my need to work on making my gauge more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">If theres one thing I’ve learned about myself in crochet obsession 2.0, its that I enjoy long term projects much more than quicker projects.

While working on a “Oh My Blanket” for my own home, I noticed the similarities between the shell pattern and gingko patterns present in wallpaper and other textiles and decided to utilize a shell pattern for my mother’s Christmas afghan. Originally I attempted to try to create my own pattern to add stems to the leaves, but that did not work well and I stuck with the original Oh My Blanket pattern located here – https://www.mooglyblog.com/oh-my-blanket/ .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earthy watercolors and glazes are utilized in much of the art from the period and thought the new red heart supersaver ombre would be a good way to (economically) reflect that variation in colors. For this afghan I’m using redheart supersaver ombre’s “Candy Apple” and redheart supersaver solids “Cornmeal”. I’ve seen some really ornate handcrafted wooden frames used in arts and crafts pieces and I’m still trying to figure out the best way to reflect that in the border when I reach that point – i’m considering using a deep mahogany or claret colored border, possibly with some deep blue accents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’m about a foot into the project and am really enjoying how the changes in green and yellow are crocheting up and I feel like intended style is really coming through.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My mother loves arts and crafts style and I’ve always found the gingko motifs commonly found in the style to be exceptionally beautiful.

MIL! The border has been added and all the ends woven in, so it can get the official “complete” stamp! Overall, the project took approximately 2 1/2 weeks to complete which should allow me to stay on time for completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the second time I’ve used this pattern and its a perfect pattern to do when watching TV or movies since its essentially all double crochet except for the small sections that create the weave effect. The previous version and pattern suggested three colors for the afghan, but I really like the way this one turned out with four colors. My MIL likes plaids and blues/browns and I think this afghan is going to fit in perfectly in her home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My very favorite border pattern is the spot on edging by attic24 which is what I used on this afghan. The instructions can be found here – http://attic24.typepad.com/weblog/spot-on-edging-2.html (though be aware that the instructions use British terms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is a new blog, I’m still working on formatting and such and have not had the chance to photograph the afghan yet. Pictures should be included by the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lighter work schedule this week, so I am hoping to start working on my very first pattern inspired by art deco ginko leaves as well as finish up a quick shawl for myself. Fingers crossed that my idea for the ginko blanket works out and I’ll have more to share later this week!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I finished the first of my Christmas gift crochet projects last evening – the Basketweave afghan for my MIL!
